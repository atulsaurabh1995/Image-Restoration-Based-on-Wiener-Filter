# Image-Restoration-Based-on-Wiener-Filter
*  This article describes the image degradation process as a degradation system. The original image function is first convolved witmotion blur process, and then Gaussian white noise is added to obtain the final degraded image. For degraded images, this article discusses how to use the Wiener filter and to restore the image. The Wiener filter uses the minimum mean square error as a criterion for recovery.
